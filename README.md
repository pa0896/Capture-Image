This project is written to interface the OV2640 camera module which uses I2C and SPI communication with the help of a STM32 Microcontroller. I have reused the old horrendous code published by ArduCAM themselves and rewritten it using HAL libraries to get the image
The image will be captured by pressing the user button and it will be transferred via UART to the serial terminal console, which can be observed by PuTTY and the resulting RAW binary data can be copied to the python program attached, which will convert this data to an actual image
There were some functions given by the original ArduCAM code which I have used but not tested, namely the video capture mode, which will be a TODO for me at a later stage
